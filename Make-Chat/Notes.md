## HTML5 BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION => WEBSOCKET
Before we jump into building with websockets, lets take a second to look at where the WebSocket standard came from and how it works. Much of this complexity is buried into the libraries and tools we use, so lets take a minute to look at them.

As HTML5 was being developed, it became clear that the web needed a bidirectional full-duplex standard to allow for bidirectional communication. A new standard called WebSocket was recommended in June of 2008 by Michael Carter—an influential HTML5 game developer.

In February 2010, Google (being a champion of HTML5) made Chrome 4 the first browser to ship a full support of the standard and enabled by default with Safari 5.0.0 in a close second. The last was Internet Explorer 10 in December 2011.

The WebSocket standard begins with an HTTP handshake, but then switches to the WebSocket standard that does not conform to the HTTP protocol.

Here's an example of how the request for the handshake and the server's response looks:
```
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com
Server response:
```
```

HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
```

The request sends a `Sec-WebSocket-Key` which contains base64-encoded random bytes, and response responds with with a hash of the key in the `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` attribute which prevents resending old messages. This key/hash pattern does not provide any authentication, privacy, or integrity. WebSocket has unique security and privacy concerns.
