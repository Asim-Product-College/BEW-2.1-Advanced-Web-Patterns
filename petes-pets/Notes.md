<!-- Improper Use of Semicolons -->
<!-- Single quotes over double quotes -->
    - Double quotes parses shit like new line characters. It's a pintosecond faster to process if you have single quotes!

<!-- Always use fat ass arrow functions applicable -->

<!-- Don't have comments. If your code needs comments its not readable enough to the company standards. -->

<!-- Commas can't be the start of a line -->

<!-- No trailing commas. Not having the comma is a nice indication that this is the end. -->

<!-- Notes -->
    - JS Doesn't care so you don't need em but we do because it's ugly if they're not there.
